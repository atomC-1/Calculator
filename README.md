# Project name: Building a Calculator with [javascirpt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).
# Purpose: 

Experience computation and arithmetics and calulation and algorithm.

# Conclusion:

Computations are not arthmetic operations nor calculations.
# Facts:
* Calculators can be implementing algorithm not calculating arithmetic operations.
* Differnce between [Calulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation) [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic) and [algorithm](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%95%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%98).

# Why make: It looks easy to make atomic operations of numbers.

# Get to know limits of JavaScripts when declaring or allocating variables and not a good option to make complicated operation in web front-end, main reason is because JS engine is way it is.(Get a sense of Turing-completeness)

## Strategy of programming with javascript.

1. Use ```let``` always.
2. Use ```var``` if neccessary.

   Result: unexpected calulation of numbers.

   Solution: Use Tsx.

# Try it with React.js
# Try it with Cordova
# Try it with Jsx
# Try it with Tsx
