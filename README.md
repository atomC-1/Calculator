# Why make: It looks easy to make atomic operations of numbers.

# Get to know limits of JavaScripts when declaring or allocating variables and not a good option to make complicated operation in web front-end, main reason is because JS engine is way it is.(Get a sense of Turing-completeness)

## Strategy of programming the program.

1. Use ```let``` always.
2. Use ```var``` if neccessary.

   Result: unexpected calulation of numbers.

   Solution: Use Tsx.

# Try it with React.js
# Try it with Cordova
# Try it with Jsx
# Try it with Tsx
